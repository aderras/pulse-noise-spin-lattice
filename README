This is a README file for the pulse-noise-thermal-collapse program.

REFERENCES

Pulse noise method for spin systems was proposed in:

Extraction of the escape rate from the collapse/transition times is described in the Appendix to:

Method was implemented on isolated 2D magnetic skyrmion in:

FOLDERS

data/
The data folder in the main directory stores all processed data and the raw data already calculated. 
*Note that within julia-files there is a folder called data. When running the code on your system results of computation will save there. 

img/
Stores figures from post-processing

julia-files/
Contains all the pulse-noise script files

mm-files/
Contains all Wolfram Mathematica files which process thermal collapse data. 

----------------------------------

EVALUATING THERMAL COLLAPSE SCRIPT

To run the script, navigate to the julia-files directory from terminal and run the script with ./main_run.jl

To change evaluation parameters, open main_run.jl and follow instructions there. It is also shown there how to input arguments from command line. 

NOTE ON DIPOLE-DIPOLE
There is no periodic boundary condition for DDI at the moment, so computations using dipole-dipole interaction should set this parameter to false.

-----------------------------------

RESULTS AND POST-PROCESSING

The results of thermal collapse computation are saved in the folder julia-files/data.

Sample results of computations done on the cluster are found in data/raw-collapse-data.

*NOTE: Results files at the moment do not distinguish between different initial conditions. It is suggested that one organizes folders according to the appropriate initial condition.

-----------------------------------

SAMPLE DATA

Some examples for a skyrmion initial condition are provided. We provide both raw collapse data and processed collapse times.
